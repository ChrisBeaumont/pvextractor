Otherwise, there's one main function,\r\n`pvdiagram <pvextractor/pvextractor.py>`_, that takes a data cube and a series of\r\npoints and returns a PV array.  It is based on scipy's map_coordinates.\r\n\r\nFor an example use case, see `this notebook\r\n<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/keflavich/pvextractor/master/examples/IRAS%252005358%2520Slicing.ipynb>`_.\r\n","google":"UA-37306139-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
